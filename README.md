#freeCodeCamp Notes



This repository reproduces the notes and challenges in the freeCodeCamp tutorials in pdf form.

The ciriculum content is free to use from FCC, but license agreements require me to state that these notes are endorsed by FCC and that are to be supplied free of charge. (Yay open source!)
Original license agreement for the FCC repo and ciriculum can be found in the fcc_legal directory.

I have deleted a lot of the original FFC content and only kept the curriculum directory. The original repository with all the code can found here: https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/freeCodeCamp

Essentially, this repo with parse challenges in the curriculum directory, and format them in a LaTeX pdf.
